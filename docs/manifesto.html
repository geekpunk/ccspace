<p><b>MISSION</b></p>
<p>
Our goals as the Charm City Art Space are as follows:<br/>
To act as a creative outlet for DIY performance, music, and art.<br/>
To work as a center for independent thought, constructive discussion,
and creative expression.<br/>
To thrive as a headquarters for autonomous education and as a
resource for community awareness.<br/>
To survive as a place to talk and meet new people of like mind in
comfort and tranquility.<br/>
To focus our energies as a buffer to filter out negative influences
including but not limited to: racism, sexism, classism, homophobia,
ageism, violence and judgmental fundamentalism.<br/>
To provide a space free from drugs and alcohol where all are welcome.<br/>
All decision making shall be a collective effort with equal weight given
to all.</p>
<p><b>Partnership with Hollaback! Baltimore</b><br/>
Charm City Art Space has signed the Hollaback Bmore Safer Space Pledge. We share their vision: a world where street harassment is not tolerated and where we all enjoy equal access to public spaces.<br/><br/>

Our staff is trained to remove anyone who is harassing women or members of the LGBTQIA communities in our space. This includes leering, rude comments, touching, and any other behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable. Please speak out and notify our staff immediately of any issues you encounter. We will be happy deal to deal with the situation. Your safety and enjoyment are paramount. We’re here to help.<br/><br/>

If you would like to report a problem anonymously, please contact us: <a href="mailto:charmcityartspace@gmail.com">charmcityartspace@gmail.com</a>.<br/><br/>

If you would like to learn more about Hollaback! Baltimore, the Safer Space Campaign, or actions you can take to help end street harassment, visit their <a href="http://www.bmore.ihollaback.org/">website</a>.</p>
<p><b>OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES</b></p>
<p><b>Meetings</b><br/>
  Meetings for the Charm City Art Space (from hereon referred to as the Space 
  or CCAS) will be held once every other month. All members and non-members are welcome 
  during the meetings. Membership dues may be collected at the meetings and topics 
  that effect the space will be discussed. The meetings will usually be scheduled 
  for the first Wednesday of every other month at 7 p.m. as events permit. </p>
<p><b>Membership</b><br/>
The CCAS has two levels of membership.<br>
  The first level is <b>Promoter</b>. This costs $30 a year. The money 
  is used to help us pay rent, utilities, and maintenance. With this membership, 
  you are able to book events at the Space. You must be a member for one month and help to staff at least two shows before you can put on an event.<br/>
  The second level is <b>Staffer</b>. This is granted after staffing two shows at the Space, one on door and one on sound. Staffers have all the same benefits as Promoters except for the ability to book events.<br/>
  Memberships are open to all who are interested.<br/>
    You will receive a membership packet including a membership card, CCAS guidelines, and other info.
</br></p>
<p><b>Rules</b><br/>
During events, there will  be two staff members working with the promote: one working sound and the other working the door. Additional staffers will be scheduled for larger shows as the need arises. The promoter will be taking care of the bands and keeping things running in a timely manner.<br/>
<br/>
Escorts to your car are available upon request. We believe we are
located in a safe, well lit neighborhood, but we also realize we can
never be too careful with personal safety.<br>
<br/>
CCAS is an alcohol/drug free space. Plese respect that. There are many bars near CCAS (one right next door) should you be interested in a drink.<br/>
<br/>
We are located in a residential area so please be respectful of the neighborhood and keep the noise down while outside of the Space.</br></p>
<p><b>BOOKING</b></p>
<p>
The CCAS is committed to providing a forum for the type of art that is
in line with our mission statement.  This includes visual works of art as well as musical works as well. The CCAS reserves the right to refuse
the exhibition of art, or let bands play that are either a risk to the
space or do not match our mission. This includes bands of a racist, 
sexist, and/or homophobic nature.</p>
<p><b>Art Events</b><br/>
Members are allowed to set up art events. The space itself is free, but
if anything is sold through the space, a percentage of the sale will go
to the Space. The percentage should be agreed upon before the start of
the art event. If art gets damaged the CCAS may be able to help reimburse 
the artist, but they must understand that this is a DIY space, and our 
resources are limited.</p>
<p>Gallery questions should be directed to Kate Frese - <a href="mailto:kate@katefrese.com">kate@katefrese.com</a></p>
<p><b>Bands</b><br/>
Bands should contact promoters individually to book events. Go to <a href="booking.html">the 
booking page</a>, for a list of current promoters. The promoter is responsible 
for booking and advertising the event, not the CCAS. </p>
<p><b>Promoters</b><br/>
Members holding a <b>Promoter Membership</b> can book events after their month 
long probation period and after they have helped staff at least two shows. This period is so that we feel you have a certain level of commitment to the Space and so you get to know how things operate. We hope you will take this time to help out at other events and meet your fellow CCAS members. A percentage of money donated at the door will go to CCAS to cover the costs of running the Space. 
Weekday door times (as in Sunday through Thursday) are to start between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. and end by 10 p.m. We have residents in the building and these times have been agreed upon with them. There are no exceptions.</p>
